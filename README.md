# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts **California housing prices** using the [California Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices/data).
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end **machine learning workflow**, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to understand correlations and distributions.
* **Model Training**:

  * Linear Regression (baseline model)
  * Random Forest Regressor (for improved accuracy)
* **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, MSE, Median Absolute Error, and R² score.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Results

* Linear Regression provided a baseline performance.
* Random Forest Regressor achieved **higher accuracy** and better captured non-linear patterns in the data.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest.
* Trying other models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
* Deploying the model as a web app.
